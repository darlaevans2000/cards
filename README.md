# cards
 Take-home challenge in VueJS
- npm run dev

Is there a way to make only one card flip with @toggle-visible="$emit('toggle-visible')" ? 
I think there is, if I was doing this in vanilla js I would have given the cards a unique class name and toggled visibility in a for loop. I am unsure though!
